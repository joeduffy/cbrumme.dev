# Chris Brumme's Weblog

A mirror of Chris Brumme's weblog, which has since gone missing.

Chris was an architect and software engineer at Microsoft who helped to build the Common Language Runtime (CLR), the virtual machine that underpins the .NET Framework and C# programming language.

In the early 2000s, Chris wrote many valuable technical deep dives into how the CLR works. His posts document subtle and fascinating details of the runtime and why certain choices were made.

.NET recently [turned 20](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/happy-20th-anniversary-net/) and rereading these posts offers a nostalgic and fun walk down memory lane.
