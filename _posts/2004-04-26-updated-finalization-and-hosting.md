My original posts on Finalization and Hosting had some hokey XXXXX markers in place of content, where that content hadn't already been disclosed in some form.  Now that the Visual Studio 2005 Community Preview is available, I've gone back to those two posts and replaced the XXXXX markers with real text.

Also, it's obviously been a while since my last post.  I started writing something this weekend, but the weather here has been spectacular and I was compelled to go outside and play.  I'll try to have something in the next couple of weeks.
