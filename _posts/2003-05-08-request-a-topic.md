If there's a topic related to the CLR, feel free to drop me a line asking me to talk about it.  I have a very time-consuming day job and a full life outside of work, so expect a long delay before I address your topic.  Or I might feel I have nothing interesting to say about it...  But you never know.

Obviously I can't help you with stuff like "I'm trying to get my Web Service working with Passport and..." or "While I'm waiting for a Mouse Up during a drag operation..."

I'm more suited to questions like, "How do you maintain type safety when you dispatch methods on value types, since the instances aren't self-describing?"
